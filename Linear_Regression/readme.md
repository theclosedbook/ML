Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is called "linear" because it assumes that the relationship between the variables is linear, meaning that there is a straight line that best fits the data.

In a simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable and one dependent variable. The goal is to find the equation of a line that best fits the data points. The line is defined by two parameters: the intercept (b) and the slope (m). The equation of the line is y = mx + b, where y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable.

To find the parameters of the line, we use the method of least squares, which minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values of the dependent variable and the actual values. In other words, we find the line that best fits the data by minimizing the distance between the line and the data points.

Once we have found the parameters of the line, we can use it to make predictions about the dependent variable for new values of the independent variable. This is called "regression" because we are predicting the value of the dependent variable based on the value of the independent variable.

Linear regression can be extended to multiple regression, where there are multiple independent variables. In this case, the goal is to find a hyperplane that best fits the data points. The equation of the hyperplane is y = b + m1x1 + m2x2 + ... + mkxk, where y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ..., xk are the independent variables, and b, m1, m2, ..., mk are the parameters of the hyperplane.

Example For Linear Regression
Suppose you have a dataset of the number of hours people spend studying for an exam and their corresponding scores on the exam. Your goal is to use linear regression to model the relationship between the hours studied (independent variable) and the exam score (dependent variable) to predict the exam score for a given number of hours studied.

First, you would plot the data points on a scatterplot with the hours studied on the x-axis and the exam scores on the y-axis. If there is a linear relationship between the two variables, you should see a general trend that as the number of hours studied increases, so does the exam score.

Next, you would use the method of least squares to find the equation of the line that best fits the data points. This line would have an intercept (b) and a slope (m) that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted values of the exam score and the actual values.

Once you have the equation of the line, you can use it to predict the exam score for a given number of hours studied. For example, if the equation of the line is y = 2x + 50, where y is the exam score and x is the number of hours studied, then you can predict that a person who studies for 5 hours would score 60 on the exam (2(5) + 50).

Linear regression can also be used to estimate the coefficients of a model with more than one independent variable. For example, you could use linear regression to model the relationship between a person's age, income, and education level, and their likelihood of voting in an election. In this case, the equation of the line would have three coefficients instead of just one, and the method of least squares would be used to find the values of these coefficients that best fit the data.
