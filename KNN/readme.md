K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric algorithm, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.

The KNN algorithm works by finding the K nearest data points in the training dataset to a new data point, based on some similarity measure such as Euclidean distance. The value of K is a hyperparameter that needs to be chosen prior to training the model.

For a classification task, the class of the new data point is determined by the majority vote of the K nearest neighbors. For example, if K=5 and three of the nearest neighbors belong to class A and two belong to class B, then the new data point is classified as class A.

For a regression task, the value of the new data point is determined by the mean or median value of the K nearest neighbors. For example, if K=5 and the values of the nearest neighbors are 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, then the value of the new data point is the average of these values, which is 5.2.

KNN has some advantages and disadvantages. One of the advantages is that it is easy to understand and implement, and it does not require any training time. Another advantage is that it can work well with small and noisy datasets. However, one of the disadvantages is that it can be computationally expensive for large datasets, since it requires computing the distances between each data point. Additionally, it is sensitive to the choice of the hyperparameter K, which can affect the performance of the model.

Suppose you have a dataset of 20 fruits with their weights and colors, where 10 of them are apples and 10 of them are oranges. Your goal is to use KNN to classify a new fruit as either an apple or an orange based on its weight and color.
First, you would preprocess the data by encoding the colors as numerical values (e.g., 0 for red and 1 for orange), and by splitting the data into a training set and a testing set.
Next, you would choose a value for K (e.g., K=3) and use KNN to find the K nearest neighbors of the new fruit in the training set based on their weights and colors. This involves computing the distance between the new fruit and each fruit in the training set, and selecting the K fruits with the smallest distances.
Once you have identified the K nearest neighbors, you would use the majority vote to classify the new fruit as either an apple or an orange. For example, if two of the K nearest neighbors are apples and one is an orange, then the new fruit would be classified as an apple.
To evaluate the performance of the KNN model, you would use the testing data to calculate the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of the predictions.
In this example, KNN can be a simple and effective way to classify fruits based on their weights and colors. However, the choice of the hyperparameter K can affect the performance of the model, and it may require some experimentation to find the optimal value of K for the given dataset.
